## Introduction
Dessinbly! What the hell is this?

> Dessin in French means drawing <br>
> Squeeze _Dessin_ + _Assembly_ altogether .. Voila you get _Dessinbly_ ðŸ™Œ

Assembly is more than adding two numbers together. It is a totally different life!
This project is meant to let you get to know more about assembly, procedures, segments, and interrupts while having fun ðŸ‘».

## Technologies

The project is implemented in Assembly for Intel 8086/8088 architecture, with EMU8086:
* no external modules are imported, every single procedure is implemented by me ðŸ˜Ž
* the program supports different colors. So, enjoy!

## Launch

 How to Launch?
> Have a look at the executive file. RUN it. Easy ha? <br>
> Running the file, the screen turns into a black canvas. <br>
> Tested on **Windows 7**. Most probably, not working on **Windows 8/10**

I am Linux user, how can I run it?
> You're most welcome. See to-do list

How it works?
> Use **left click** to draw <br>
> Use **right click** to change the color <br>
